# SwiftNotes
### Programmatic UI

### Optionals / Force Unwrapping

### UITableView

### In-App Purchases
- 30% transaction fee
- Tip: make app free to download and give user 80% of full functionality of app, then use paywall (in-app purchases) for advanced functionality like removing ads/premium features/etc.
- Need Apple Developer program and physical device to simulate in-app purchases
